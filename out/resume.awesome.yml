    quote: "No egos here, just a big smile, a wonderful personality, combined with a can-do attitude that makes for a wonderful addition to any team!\n\nI had the pleasure of working with Keith for two years, during which time I witnessed a profound amount of professional growth. Keith has a wonderful attitude, and when the opportunity arose for him to take on more responsibilities he jumped in with both feet and did not disappoint. \n\nKeith is the rare individual who is simultaneously willing to listen as well as push his own thoughts out there - the end result being a person who is equally as adept at being the student as well as the teacher. I truly hope I will have the opportunity to work with him again."

    quote: "William is an esteemed colleague at Teletech. He was my ASG for over a year and, as a technical advisor, continually impressed me and my fellow support agents. His technical knowledge in reference to computer hardware and software troubleshooting was among the best in our call center. Even more impressive was his ability to quickly find solutions \"under fire\" and convey understandable answers to us.\r\n  Another important point to note about William is his integrity. William has proven repeatedly that he will live up to any promises he makes, do it in the time frame he promised, and deliver a quality service as a net result. William will rise to the top as the result of helping others, rather than at the expense of others.  He is a hard worker and is very solution-oriented.\r\n  I am a much better tech agent as the result having Wiiliam as my ASG.  I have consistently been ranked in the top 10 per cent of all agents locally and globally, and I must give William his credit in this. With his technical assistance as my first ASG out of my training, I quickly gained the technical confidence needed for this job. It was comforting to know that I had him there to support any issues which may arise.\r\n  I believe that William is one of those rare catches you are looking for as an employer or a client."
